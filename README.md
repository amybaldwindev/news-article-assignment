News Article Assignment

I was given a PSD and images contained within the document, of a news article to replicate to practice translating things from it's design into HTML and CSS. Assignment required an internal stylesheet. 

This project was completed as part of Codetalk, a bootcamp based in Venice, Los Angeles, CA.
